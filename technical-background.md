## Seminar Title: Sound synthesis of gongs using a modal scheme – development and examples

## Speaker: Dr Michele Ducceschi (UME ENSTA, Paris Tech, France)

### Seminar Abstract

Sound synthesis of gongs can be obtained, in a first approximation, by solving the dynamical equations of a flat plate. 
In fact, despite a trivial geometry, a plate vibrating in a nonlinear regime shares the same salient characteristics as a gong or a cymbal. 
Particularly, the degree of nonlinearity can be given in terms of the amplitude of vibrations. 
In this talk, the nonlinear plate equations will be described and a solution in terms of the linear modes given.

Examples will range from typical linear feautures (bell-like sounds and plate reverb) 
to the most dramatic nonlinear effects (gongs struck at high amplitudes). 
The talk will feature video contributions as well as a web-app for wave visualisation (development by Theo Armour).

### Speaker Bio

Michele Ducceschi is a post-doctoral researcher at the Unité de Mecanique at ENSTA (Paris). 
His current research focuses on the development of the dynamics of a permanently magnetised elastic beam for energy harvesting. 
In addition, he is continuing to improve a sound-synthesis algorithm for gongs developed during his PhD, based on modal decomposition. 
Michele received a BSc in Physics from the Università degli Studi di Padova, Italy (2008), 
an MSc in Acoustics and Music Technology from the University of Edinburgh (2010) 
and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from ENSTA and École Polytechnique, France (2014).
