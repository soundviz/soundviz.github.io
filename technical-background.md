### Seminar Title: Sound synthesis of gongs using a modal scheme – development and examples

### Speaker: Dr Michele Ducceschi (UME ENSTA, Paris Tech, France)

### Seminar Abstract

Sound synthesis of gongs can be obtained, in a first approximation, by solving the dynamical equations of a flat plate. 
In fact, despite a trivial geometry, a plate vibrating in a nonlinear regime shares the same salient characteristics as a gong or a cymbal. 
Particularly, the degree of nonlinearity can be given in terms of the amplitude of vibrations. 
In this talk, the nonlinear plate equations will be described and a solution in terms of the linear modes given.

Examples will range from typical linear feautures (bell-like sounds and plate reverb) 
to the most dramatic nonlinear effects (gongs struck at high amplitudes). 
The talk will feature video contributions as well as a web-app for wave visualisation (development by Theo Armour).

### Speaker Bio

Michele Ducceschi is a post-doctoral researcher at the Unit&#233; de Mecanique at ENSTA (Paris). 
His current research focuses on the development of the dynamics of a permanently magnetised elastic beam for energy harvesting. 
In addition, he is continuing to improve a sound-synthesis algorithm for gongs developed during his PhD, based on modal decomposition. 
Michele received a BSc in Physics from the Universit&#224; degli Studi di Padova, Italy (2008), 
an MSc in Acoustics and Music Technology from the University of Edinburgh (2010) 
and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from ENSTA and &#201;cole Polytechnique, France (2014).

### Abstract: [Numerical Simulations of Wave Turbulence in Vibrating Plates]( http://www.ness-music.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ducceschi_michele.pdf ):_

This work is concerned with numerical simulations of wave turbulence in elastic plates. 
A finite difference code is used to simulate the turbulent regime of a plate vibrating at large amplitudes, hence allowing a computational framework that is closer to the experiments as compared to already published results. 
Physical boundary conditions are enforced, and the harmonic forcing is pointwise. An energy-conserving time-stepping scheme is used hence allowing for a perfect discrete conservation of energy in the conservative case. 
Undamped simulations are run first to check the numerical results with theoretical predictions. 
The absence of damping allows to generate an energy cascade up the numerical cutoff frequency (close to the Nyquist frequency). 
The influence of different geometrical parameters (e.g. the thickness) on derived quantities such, for instance, the injected power and the spectral amplitudes is quantified. Relations between these quantities is derived in the form of power laws.
